    <h1>The New Commandment</h1>
    <p><strong>John 13:34–35</strong></p>
    <p><em>Love as the Mark of True Discipleship</em></p>
  </header>

  <p>
    Since Jesus arrived in Bethany, events had already been moving steadily toward His death.
    There, He shared a supper with Lazarus—the man He had raised from the dead—whose very presence
    testified to His divine authority. News of the miracle spread widely, drawing many to believe,
    while hardening the resolve of the chief priests and Pharisees, who began plotting the deaths
    of both Jesus and Lazarus.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Jesus entered Jerusalem for Passover, the city was filled with pilgrims eager to see Him.
    Riding humbly on a donkey, He was met with palm branches and shouts of “Hosanna! Blessed is He
    who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.” The crowd welcomed Him as Messiah,
    expecting deliverance from Roman oppression, unaware that He had come to accomplish a far
    greater redemption—the salvation of their souls.
  </p>

  <h2>Love Demonstrated Before It Was Commanded</h2>

  <p>
    After the Passover meal, Jesus gathered privately with His disciples in the Upper Room.
    Away from the crowds, He revealed a more intimate side of His ministry—marked by tenderness,
    humility, and care. Before speaking a single word about love, He demonstrated it.
    Rising from the table, He laid aside His garments, poured water into a basin, and began
    washing the disciples’ feet—taking the position of a servant.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this act, Jesus redefined greatness and showed that love in His kingdom is expressed
    through humility and self-giving service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only after this example did Jesus speak of Judas’s betrayal, assuring the disciples that
    nothing unfolding that night was beyond His knowledge or authority. When Judas departed
    into the night, Jesus gave His new commandment: that His followers love one another as He
    had loved them.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you,
      that you also love one another.”
    </p>
    <cite>John 13:34</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Though the Law had long commanded love for one’s neighbor, this commandment was new in its
    standard and focus. Love was no longer measured by self-reference—as yourself—but by
    Christ’s own example—as I have loved you, a love already illustrated on the floor of the
    Upper Room and soon to be completed at the cross.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus emphasized this command repeatedly and sealed it with prayer—asking the Father that
    His disciples be perfected in unity, just as He and the Father are one. This unity was not
    for their sake alone, but so that the world would know.
  </p>

  <h2>The Ethics of Christ’s Community</h2>

  <p>
    This new commandment did more than instruct individual behavior—it defined the ethics of
    Christ’s community. Love became the governing principle by which believers would serve,
    forgive, endure, and remain united.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus made this unmistakably clear when He declared that this love would be the visible
    marker of true discipleship:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”
    </p>
    <cite>John 13:35</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Love was no longer theoretical or abstract. It was relational, lived out in daily
    interaction, and observable to others. In this way, Jesus bound the credibility of His
    mission, in human eyes, to the way His disciples treated one another.
  </p>

  <h2>Love Revealed in Full</h2>

  <p>
    This commandment was spoken the night before the cross and cannot be separated from what
    followed. The basin and towel pointed forward to the nails and the wood. Love was no longer
    explained—it was embodied, costly, and complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus did not merely teach love—He defined it by His life and death. From that night
    forward, love would be understood through the cross, measured by sacrifice, and expressed
    through humble obedience.
  </p>

  <h2>In Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>New Standard</strong> — Love measured by Christ’s love.</li>
    <li><strong>New Source</strong> — Commanded by Christ’s authority.</li>
    <li><strong>New Community</strong> — Governs life among believers.</li>
    <li><strong>New Revelation</strong> — Fully revealed in the cross.</li>
    <li><strong>New Power</strong> — Made possible by the Holy Spirit.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This raises an important question: If love defines true discipleship, what does it mean
    to keep Christ’s commandments? Is obedience mere rule-keeping, or does it flow from
    abiding in His love?
  </p>

  <p>
    In the next segment, we will turn to <strong>John 15:10</strong>, where Jesus explains how
    love and obedience are inseparably connected.
