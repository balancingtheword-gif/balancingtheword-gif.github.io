<p class="post-meta">Posted on December 18, 2025</p>

<p>
In recent weeks, public attention has turned toward reports of the Hindu community in
Moncure, Chatham County, North Carolina, constructing multiple temples and now erecting
a 155-foot statue of Lord Murugan, a so-called “warrior god.” When completed, it will
surpass even the Statue of Liberty in height.
</p>

<p>
The monument itself is not the most alarming issue. What is far more concerning is the
response it provoked within certain Christian circles.
</p>

<p>
Voices claiming the titles of prophets and apostles began declaring—decreeing—that
Christians must seize economic dominion or risk losing a “spiritual war.” Scriptures such
as “possess the gates” (Genesis 22:17) and “occupy till I come” (Luke 19:13) were invoked
as mandates for political control, cultural dominance, and the construction of God’s
Kingdom through human power structures.
</p>

<blockquote>
This is a grave distortion of Scripture.
</blockquote>

<h2>Who Truly Builds the Kingdom?</h2>

<p>
Only God grants the ability to “possess the gate.” It is not seized by human effort,
fasting campaigns, or prophetic theatrics. No amount of declaring or decreeing can compel
God’s hand. Every blessing flows according to His will and His timing.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, “occupy till I come” was never a command to dominate governments or conquer
culture. It is a call to faithfulness—to live uprightly, steward responsibly, and proclaim
the gospel of peace where we are planted.
</p>

<p>
It is obedience, not domination. Faithfulness, not force.
</p>

<blockquote>
“I will build My church.” (Matthew 16:18)
</blockquote>

<p>
He did not assign that responsibility to movements, systems, or self-appointed leaders.
Christ alone is the Builder. Christ alone is the King.
</p>

<h2>The True Commission of the Church</h2>

<p>
Nowhere in Scripture are believers commanded to build God’s Kingdom on earth. That work
belongs to God alone.
</p>

<p>
Instead, Jesus gave a commission far more costly—and far more eternal:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations…” (Matthew 28:19–20)
</blockquote>

<p>
The mission was never about influence, platforms, or monuments bearing our names. The
gospel has never been a strategy for earthly dominance. It has always been a summons to
surrender—to form disciples fully submitted to Christ.
</p>

<p>
We are not called to manufacture kingdoms centered on men. We are commanded to raise up
faithful followers of Jesus, governed by His Word and led by His Spirit.
</p>

<h2>A Kingdom Not of This World</h2>

<p>
When Jesus returns as KING of kings and LORD of lords, He will not seek permission from
political systems, economic powers, or judicial authorities. His Kingdom is not of this
world (John 18:36).
</p>

<blockquote>
“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed.” (Daniel 2:44)
</blockquote>

<p>
Christ does not need our help to rule. He reigns by divine authority, eternal power, and
sovereign decree.
</p>

<p>
When we pray:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10)
</blockquote>

<p>
we are not commissioning the Church to build the Kingdom by human hands. This prayer is a
prophetic cry for divine fulfillment—a longing for the return of the King and the descent
of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:2).
</p>

<h2>The Cost of True Discipleship</h2>

<p>
Jesus never softened the call to follow Him.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forsake all competing allegiances (Luke 14:33)</li>
  <li>Love Christ above family, comfort, and even life itself (Luke 14:26)</li>
  <li>Take up the cross daily and follow Him (Mark 8:34)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not poetic language. It is a call to total surrender.
</p>

<p>
Every believer is assigned a cross—the death of self-will, the endurance of rejection,
unwavering obedience under pressure, and a life wholly yielded to Christ’s authority.
</p>

<p>
This is the narrow way. This is the cost. This is the path that leads to eternal life.
</p>

<h2>Citizens of Another Kingdom</h2>

<blockquote>
“A chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.” (1 Peter 2:9)
</blockquote>

<p>
Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Scripture knows nothing of dual allegiance.
</p>

<p>
This world is passing away. Its monuments will crumble. Its glory will fade. But those who
store their treasures in heaven will never lose what truly matters (Matthew 6:19–20).
</p>

<p>
Let the world build what it will. We rejoice that our names are written in heaven
(Luke 10:20).
</p>

<h2>The Call Is Clear</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Love the Lord your God with undivided devotion (Matthew 22:37)</li>
  <li>Present your life as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1–2)</li>
  <li>Walk in holiness (1 Peter 1:15–16)</li>
  <li>Be faithful stewards (1 Corinthians 4:2)</li>
  <li>Go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19–20)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not optional. This is not symbolic. This is the mandate of the Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stand up. Step forward. Live the gospel.</strong>
