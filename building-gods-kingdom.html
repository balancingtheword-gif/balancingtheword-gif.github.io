<h3>Building God’s Kingdom: A Call to True Discipleship</h3>
<p class="muted">December 18, 2025</p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<p>
In recent weeks, public attention has turned toward reports of the Hindu community
in Moncure, Chatham County, North Carolina, constructing multiple temples and now
erecting a 155-foot statue of Lord Murugan, a so-called “warrior god.” When completed,
it will surpass even the Statue of Liberty in height.
</p>

<p>
The monument itself is not the most alarming issue. What is far more concerning is
the response it provoked within certain Christian circles.
</p>

<p>
Voices claiming the titles of prophets and apostles began declaring—decreeing—that
Christians must seize economic dominion or risk losing a “spiritual war.” Scriptures
such as “possess the gates” (Genesis 22:17) and “occupy till I come” (Luke 19:13) were
invoked as mandates for political control, cultural dominance, and the construction
of God’s Kingdom through human power structures.
</p>

<p><strong>This is a grave distortion of Scripture.</strong></p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<h4>Who Truly Builds the Kingdom?</h4>

<p>
Only God grants the ability to “possess the gate.” It is not seized by human effort,
fasting campaigns, or prophetic theatrics. No amount of declaring or decreeing can
compel God’s hand. Every blessing flows according to His will and His timing.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, “occupy till I come” was never a command to dominate governments or conquer
culture. It is a call to faithfulness—to live uprightly, steward responsibly, and
proclaim the gospel of peace where we are planted. It is obedience, not domination.
Faithfulness, not force.
</p>

<p>
Jesus Himself declared:
</p>

<p><strong>“I will build My church.” (Matthew 16:18)</strong></p>

<p>
He did not assign that responsibility to movements, systems, or self-appointed
leaders. Christ alone is the Builder. Christ alone is the King.
</p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<h4>The True Commission of the Church</h4>

<p>
Nowhere in Scripture are believers commanded to build God’s Kingdom on earth. That
work belongs to God alone.
</p>

<p>
Instead, Jesus gave a commission far more costly—and far more eternal:
</p>

<p><strong>
“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations…”<br>
(Matthew 28:19–20)
</strong></p>

<p>
The mission was never about influence, platforms, or monuments bearing our names.
The gospel has never been a strategy for earthly dominance. It has always been a
summons to surrender—to form disciples fully submitted to Christ.
</p>

<p>
We are not called to manufacture kingdoms centered on men. We are commanded to raise
up faithful followers of Jesus, governed by His Word and led by His Spirit.
</p>

<p><strong>
Anything less is a distortion of the Great Commission.
</strong></p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<h4>A Kingdom Not of This World</h4>

<p>
When Jesus returns as KING of kings and LORD of lords, He will not seek permission
from political systems, economic powers, or judicial authorities. His Kingdom is not
of this world (John 18:36).
</p>

<p>
Daniel foresaw it clearly:
</p>

<p><strong>
“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed.”<br>
(Daniel 2:44)
</strong></p>

<p>
Christ does not need our help to rule. He reigns by divine authority, eternal power,
and sovereign decree.
</p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<p><strong>
“Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven”<br>
(Matthew 6:10)
</strong></p>

<p>
This prayer is not commissioning the Church to build the Kingdom by human hands. It
is a prophetic cry for divine fulfillment—a longing for the return of the King and
the descent of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:2).
</p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<h4>The Cost of True Discipleship</h4>

<p>
Jesus never softened the call to follow Him.
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Forsake all competing allegiances (Luke 14:33)</li>
  <li>Love Christ above family, comfort, and even life itself (Luke 14:26)</li>
  <li>Take up the cross daily and follow Him (Mark 8:34)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not poetic language. It is a call to total surrender.
</p>

<p>
Every believer is assigned a cross—the death of self-will, the endurance of rejection,
unwavering obedience under pressure, and a life wholly yielded to Christ’s authority.
</p>

<p><strong>
This is the narrow way.<br>
This is the cost.<br>
This is the path that leads to eternal life.
</strong></p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<h4>Citizens of Another Kingdom</h4>

<p><strong>
“A chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.”<br>
(1 Peter 2:9)
</strong></p>

<p>
Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Scripture knows nothing of dual
allegiance.
</p>

<p>
This world is passing away. Its monuments will crumble. Its glory will fade. But
those who store their treasures in heaven will never lose what truly matters
(Matthew 6:19–20).
</p>

<p>
Let the world build what it will. We rejoice that our names are written in heaven
(Luke 10:20).
</p>

<div class="accent"></div>

<h4>The Call Is Clear</h4>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Love the Lord your God with undivided devotion (Matthew 22:37)</li>
  <li>Present your life as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1–2)</li>
  <li>Walk in holiness (1 Peter 1:15–16)</li>
  <li>Be faithful stewards (1 Corinthians 4:2)</li>
  <li>Go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19–20)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>
This is not optional.<br>
This is not symbolic.<br>
This is the mandate of the Kingdom.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Stand up. Step forward. Live the gospel.
</strong></p>
