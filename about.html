    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p>
      From an early age, my life was marked by instability, trauma, and loss. Throughout
      childhood and adolescence, I experienced abuse, frequent displacement, and foster
      care, learning to adapt quickly while longing for safety, love, and belonging.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even in those years, God was drawing me to Himself. The Bible and prayer became my
      refuge—places of comfort, peace, and hope when nothing else felt secure. Though I
      believed in God and Jesus, I did not yet understand salvation, and for many years I
      searched for freedom and healing.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a season of deep brokenness as a young wife and mother, I cried out to Jesus with
      a surrendered heart. In that moment, I experienced true forgiveness, renewal, and
      redemption. Shortly afterward, I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and my life
      was forever changed. Since then, God has continually renewed my mind, healed my heart,
      and transformed my life—giving me a deep desire to serve others, teach His Word, and
      point all people to the hope, freedom, and power found in Jesus Christ.
    </p>

    <p class="journey-close"><em>
      My journey stands as a testimony that God redeems, restores, and empowers all who come
      to Him in faith.
