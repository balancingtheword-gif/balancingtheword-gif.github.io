    <section class="about-section" id="my-story">
  <h2>My Story</h2>
    
  <p>
    From an early age, my life was marked by instability, trauma, and loss. Throughout
    childhood and adolescence, I experienced abuse, frequent displacement, and foster
    care, learning to adapt quickly while longing for safety, love, and belonging.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Even in those years, God was drawing me to Himself. The Bible and prayer became my
    refuge—places of comfort, peace, and hope when nothing else felt secure. Though I
    believed in God and Jesus, I did not yet understand salvation, and for many years I
    searched for freedom and healing.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    In a season of deep brokenness as a young wife and mother, I cried out to Jesus with
    a surrendered heart. In that moment, I experienced true forgiveness, renewal, and
    redemption. Shortly afterward, I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and my life
    was forever changed. Since then, God has continually renewed my mind, healed my heart,
    and transformed my life—giving me a deep desire to serve others, teach His Word, and
    point all people to the hope, freedom, and power found in Jesus Christ.
  </p>
  <!-- NEW PARAGRAPH (now properly constrained & justified) -->
  <p>
    Beyond the work the Lord has entrusted to me, He has richly blessed my life in deeply
    personal ways. I am the mother of four incredible children and a grandmother to ten
    amazing grandchildren, each one a precious gift from His hand. In His kindness, the
    LORD has also given me a bonus family—an unexpected blessing that continues to testify
    to His goodness and faithfulness. Truly, my cup overflows with His marvelous blessings,
    and I am continually reminded that every good and perfect gift comes from Him.
  </p>
    
     <p class="journey-close"><em>
      My journey stands as a testimony that God redeems, restores, and empowers all who come
      to Him in faith.

  <section class="about-section" id="btwm-story">
    <h2>The BTWM Story</h2>

     <p>
    Since surrendering my life to the LORD, I have worshiped in churches across many
    denominations, cultures, and communities. Because of frequent moves—from large
    cities to small rural towns—I continually sought places where I could grow in faith
    and remain grounded in Scripture. Over time, this journey revealed a sobering truth.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I matured in the LORD and grew deeper in God’s Word, I found that very few churches
    faithfully teach the Scriptures in their fullness. Too often, passages are shaped to
    support man-made doctrines, personal agendas, or self-interest rather than presented
    with clarity, balance, and truth. This realization deeply burdened my heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    For many years, I ministered to children in my neighborhoods, opening my home to teach,
    love, and point them to Jesus. Though the fruit was evident, consistent support was
    lacking, and eventually, I experienced burnout. Like Peter, I became weary of being
    tossed to and fro by conflicting doctrines and messages that did not align with Scripture.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stepping away from institutional church led me back to the presence of God. The LORD
    renewed me through His Word, reigniting my passion for prayer and Scripture. This
    renewal birthed <strong>Balancing the Word Ministry</strong>—a calling to teach believers
    how to study the Bible, grow in discernment, and mature in faith. Our mission is to
    present the pure Word of God with balance between the Old and New Testaments, equipping
    believers to live out truth with clarity and conviction.
