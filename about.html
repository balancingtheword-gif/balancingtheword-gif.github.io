  <h2>My Story</h2>

  <p>
    From an early age, my life was marked by instability, trauma, and loss. Throughout
    childhood and adolescence, I experienced abuse, frequent displacement, and foster
    care, learning to adapt quickly while longing for safety, love, and belonging.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even in those years, God was drawing me to Himself. The Bible and prayer became my
    refuge—places of comfort, peace, and hope when nothing else felt secure. Though I
    believed in God and Jesus, I did not yet understand salvation, and for many years I
    searched for freedom and healing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a season of deep brokenness as a young wife and mother, I cried out to Jesus with
    a surrendered heart. In that moment, I experienced true forgiveness, renewal, and
    redemption. Shortly afterward, I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and my life
    was forever changed. Since then, God has continually renewed my mind, healed my heart,
    and transformed my life—giving me a deep desire to serve others, teach His Word, and
    point all people to the hope, freedom, and power found in Jesus Christ.
  </p>

  <p class="journey-close"><em>
    My journey stands as a testimony that God redeems, restores, and empowers all who come
    to Him in faith.
