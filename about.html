      <h2>My Story</h2>

      <p>From an early age, my life was marked by instability, trauma, and loss…</p>
      <p>Even in those years, God was drawing me to Himself…</p>
      <p>In a season of deep brokenness as a young wife and mother…</p>

      <p><em>
        My journey stands as a testimony that God redeems, restores, and empowers
        all who come to Him in faith.
